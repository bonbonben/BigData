Data files:
1. NYC taxi trip data: taxi_lab_100k.csv
2. Polygons corresponding to NYC neighborhoods: neighborhoods.poly

Make sure that you have pandas and shapely installed:
pip install pandas
pip install shapely
Or
conda install pandas
conda install shapely
(depending on what environment you have installed)

Select taxi trip IDs for which the pickup was within the query polygon given in neighborhood.poly for Midtown-Midtown South
1. Using brute force, comparing each trip pickup with the polygon. How long does executing the query take?
2. Create a grid index on the Taxi data, and perform the query using the index
(a) Create a grid index of size 1024 x 1024
(b) Create a grid indexes of size n x n, where n = {128,256,512,1024,2048,4096}
(c) plot the running time of the query against the index resolution
(d) what can be inferred from this plot?
