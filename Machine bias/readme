Support for itemset I = the number of baskets containing all items in I.
• Often expressed as a fraction of the total number of baskets
• Given a support threshold s, sets of items that appear in at least s baskets are called frequent itemsets.
Confidence of this association rule is the probability of j given i1,…,ik.
•Conf(I->j) = support(I ∪ j) / support(I)

Goal:
Compute CARs that have vscore on the right-hand-side, and one or several of the following attributes on the left-hand-side: race, age , gender or marriage.
For example, you may compute the rules:
age=30, gender=1 => vdecile=1
age=40, race=1 => vdecile=2
But you should not compute the rules:
gender=0 vdecile=1 => age=30
age=30 => marriage=2
All rules you produce must have vdecile=1 or vdecile=2 on the right hand side, and should not have either vdecile=1 or vdecile=2 on the left hand side.

Place all computed rules into relations R2, R3 and PD_R3.
R2 and R3 should each contain classification association rules of sizes 2 and 3, respectively, with vdecile=0 or vdecile=1 on the right.
Only output rules that pass the support and confidence thresholds.
For each rule in R2 and R3, compute and output its support and confidence.
These should be placed into the appropriate columns in the output relations.

PD_R3 should contain a subset of the rules from R3.
Each rule in PD_R3 (1) has race as one of the attributes on the left-hand-side and (2) meets the protection threshold.

For relations R2 and R3, attribute names are stored in alphabetical order.
If your rule contains attributes age and gender on the left-hand-side, then it should be the case that R3.attr1 = ‘age’, and R3.attr2=’gender’.
You should not explicitly mention by name (hard-code) attributes other than vdecile and race anywhere in your code.
Assume that your code should still work if another attribute is added, e.g., income or education.
It is OK to refer to race and vdecile by name, since these attributes have special meaning.
