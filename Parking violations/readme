Using MapReduce and Spark to explore NYC Parking Violations

Goal:
Analyze different aspects of parking violations in NYC using both Hadoop Streaming and Spark.
1) map and reduce Python programs for the first 3 tasks
2) PySpark programs using both RDDs and DataFrames for all 7 tasks

Data:
The data we will use is open and available from NYC Open Data:
Parking Violations Issued (Fiscal Year 2016)
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus/data
Open Parking and Camera Violations
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89

The subset of the data we will use for this assignment (March 2016) can be found here:
https://vgc.poly.edu/~juliana/courses/BigData2018/Data/parking-violations.tar.gz
Note: you only need the files parking-violations.csv and open-violations.csv in the tar file above.
The included file mysql-load.sql will tell you the ordering of the columns in each table 
(which can also be found by reading about the data on the NYC Open Data sites).

Environment:
Python 3.6.5 and Spark 2.4.0
