Task 1: Generic Profiling
Profile a large collection of open data sets and derive metadata that can be used for data discovery, querying, and identification of data quality problems.

For each column in the dataset collection, extract the following metadata
1. Number of non-empty cells
2. Number of empty cells (i.e., cell with no data)
3. Number of distinct values
4. Top-5 most frequent value(s)
5. Data types (a column may contain values belonging to multiple types)

Identify the data types for each distinct column value as one of the following: INTEGER (LONG), REAL, DATE/TIME, TEXT
For each column count the total number of values as well as the distinct values for each of the above data types.

For columns that contain at least one value of type INTEGER / REAL report: Maximum value, Minimum value, Mean, Standard Deviation
For columns that contain at least one value of type DATE report: Maximum value, Minimum value
For columns that contain at least one value of type TEXT report: Top-5 Shortest value(s) (the values with shortest length), Top-5 Longest values(s) (the values with longest length), Average value length
